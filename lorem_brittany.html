                  <strong>Q:Why did you make the decision to work at Touchmark?</strong><br />
                  <i>A: When you walk into a place of employment, and you get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, then you know it&rsquo;s the right fit!

                    <strong>Q:How long did it take you to be promoted?</strong>
                    <br />
                    <i>A: I started my career at Touchmark working as a Certified Nursing Assistant. While working as a Certified Nursing Assistant, we were offered the option to get our medication aide license, and I jumped on the opportunity to expand my health care knowledge. While working as a Certified Nursing Assistant, I pursued my Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN). In 2010, I became an LPN and didn’t want to finish there, so I pursued my education to become a registered nurse. I earned my degree in July 2013 and am currently working as a nurse in assisted living.</i>
