                  <strong>Q:Why did you make the decision to work at Touchmark?</strong><br />
                  <i>A: Honestly, I needed a change from what I was doing. I was not drawn to Touchmark, specifically, but to the available position. I had a personal career path in mind, and in my previous position, I was getting nowhere. I was not at a logical starting point to begin my journey. Five years ago, I knew I could do what I am doing today; I just needed someone else to see it. Touchmark was a job to put me on my intended career path. I never expected my career to develop like it has with Touchmark. I am thankful that Touchmark not only became the place for me to prove myself; it is the place that recognized my talents and helped cultivate my career.</i>

                    <strong>Q:How long did it take you to be promoted?</strong>
                    <br />
                    <i>A: I started as a facilities technician. I primarily emptied trash and took care of heavy housekeeping&mdash;more along the lines of a custodian. I very quickly proved my worth, and before I hit my first anniversary, I took on the position of maintenance technician. With that change, I started taking on much more skilled projects and work orders. In the summer of 2013, I was promoted to a position of lead maintenance technician, and I started managing the stream of work orders as well as identifying, planning, and executing special projects. In the summer of 2014, as we were preparing to open our memory care addition, the Building Services director position opened. I was named interim director and asked to apply for the permanent position. After progressing through the interview process with other qualified candidates in September of 2014, I became the permanent director of Building Services.</i>

                    <i><br />
                    A: Although I don&rsquo;t get to do it nearly as much as I once did, my favorite part of the day is interacting with residents. I thoroughly enjoy taking time to stop and chat with residents. The conversation may start with something department-related, but rarely does it end that way.</i>

                    <i><br />
                    A: Get your foot in the door. The only limitations on where you go with this company are set by you. Work hard, continually improve, and the sky is the limit.</i>

                    <strong>Q:How does Touchmark compare to other companies you worked for?</strong>
                    <br />
                    <i>A:  Touchmark has been one of the best places I have ever worked. I have stated on several occasions that Touchmark is the only place I have ever worked where the phrase &ldquo;team member&rdquo; is true. From the bottom up, I feel as though we are a team working toward a common goal: the best possible care of residents. I am extremely grateful for the environment and culture that is Touchmark. It truly is a person-centered employer. In 2011, my family went through a very difficult time, and there was never a question about who was important to Touchmark, the position or the person. The management at Touchmark was extremely accommodating, and, more importantly, I felt as though they genuinely cared about my family and me. There is no question in my mind that this culture starts in Oregon. I hope we never lose that quality.</i>
